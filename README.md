Uses nosetests, but you don't need those installed in order to run it, just for the tests.

mafiagen.py contains functions for reading in setup info and combining it with templates for Mafia OPs. This was built for use on [Teamliquid Mafia](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/). 

To use, change `resources/newbiesetup.txt` to include the game name, cohost, and deadline you desire. Then, run `makenewbie.py`. Your results will appear in the output folder.
