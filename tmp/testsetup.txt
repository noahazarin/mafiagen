[i]Sun Tzu said, "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."  

This is also true in rhetoric.   

The best way to get a belief accepted is to fool people into thinking that they have already accepted it.

Let us play mafia.[/i]

[hr]
[center][green][b]Introduction:[/b][/green][/center]
Mafia is an educated guessing game of epic proportions. The objective of the game is to lynch or kill all mafia members before they outnumber the rest of the town. It's much like a game of poker because mafia members are also part of the town during the day and may manipulate the vote to their liking. If the mafia at any time outnumber or equal the townspeople, they win. The town's goal is to lynch all the members of the mafia.

The game is typically very active, so the thread may grow large quickly. However, it is essential to read the thread to play the game. [b]If you do not have the time or patience to read the whole thread, do not play.[/b]

[center][green][b]Rules:[/b][/green][/center]
[b]Cheating:[/b]
Cheating includes (but is not limited to):
1. Posting after death. You may have one polite goodbye post, but it may not contain any potentially game-changing information.
2. Ruining the game by doing something like hand out your mafia's member list to the town.
3. Logging on to someone else's account to get their role or looking over someone's shoulder to get their role.
4. Comparing role PM times to determine roles.
5. Posting screenshots of your inbox. 
6. Posting any PM you receive from a host.
7. Getting yourself modkilled to help your team. Your non-majority-decided death may not be used as a bargaining chip. 
8. Signing up more than once using smurf accounts.
9. Betting items outside of the game in exchange for in-game benefits.
10. Sharing accounts with other players. Only you may post on your account.
[b][blue]11. You may not reveal or hint about the identity of your coach.  You may not refer to any idea, course of action, etc. as something that was suggested by your coach.[/blue][/b]
[b]If you feel that any action you are considering may be against the spirit of the game, it is best to contact a host and ensure it is allowed before proceeding.[/b]

[center][green][b]Posting:[/b][/green][/center]
[b]Host Color:[/b]
[b][blue]The color blue is reserved for the hosts of the game to make our posts easy to notice. Please do not use it.[/b][/blue]

[b]Question Color:[/b]
[b][green]The color green is reserved for questions by players for the hosts. Use it to ask the game hosts questions about the rules. Please do us a favor and read the rules before you ask anything.[/b][/green]

[b]Activity:[/b]
You must post in this thread once per day/night cycle and vote every day while you are alive. Roughly speaking, this equates to a bare minimum of one post per 36 hours. If you fail to do so, you will be modkilled or replaced.

[b]Smurfs:[/b]
Smurfs must PM the host because TL doesn't allow multiple accounts otherwise. If the host is unaware of smurfs, you (and/or your smurf) can be banned for having multiple accounts

[b]Spam:[/b]
Spam is not tolerated, nor is any off-topic material. Do not discuss Proleague here. Do not talk about Starcraft II here. Play Mafia here.

[b]Editing:[/b]  
Editing is not allowed for any reason. Editing will result in a warning.  After that, you will be modkilled. This is the one part of the site where it is okay to be double posting, even triple-posting. "Editing" includes indirect editing like linking an image, then editing the image. Editing your profile or signature are allowed, but if you edit them for any game-related reasons (ie, breadcrumbing, sending messages, etc) this will be considered out-of-thread posting and will be punished.

[b]Inappropriate posts and use of the report post link:[/b]
If you want to post something insulting or inappropriate and know the TL mods would have a problem with it elsewhere, don't post it here. If you do, a host will warn you or modkill you and request that you be banned from future games. The hosts have the final say on what is inappropriate. If you do not like how someone is talking to you, please PM a host, Flamewheel, or Mig before involving the TL moderation staff or using the report post link. If you are unsatisfied with how the situation is resolved, then you can appeal to the TL staff normally.

[b]Ban discussions:[/b]
Please wait until this game is over to talk about modkills and bans resulting from this game.

[blue][b]Play to win.[/b][/blue]
This means you play your best to help your team win while you are alive and in the game. However, this does not mean that you should try to win by being a jerk to the other players so they all want to quit playing. 

This also means that you cannot leave the game without a good reason without a ban. These situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis. PM your host if you need to leave the game.

[hr]
[green][center][b]Out of thread communication:[/b][/green][/center]
It is common for mafia to use a medium outside of TL such as QuickTopics or IRC to communicate during the game.  Players who have not explicitly been given permission to communicate outside the thread are not allowed to attempt to infiltrate such communication channels. Players who are not mafia are not allowed to communicate about this game outside of the thread.

[hr]
[green][center][b]Voting rules:[/b][/green][/center]
1. Voting is done by posting in this thread.
2. Please vote in the following format: [b]##Vote: Zona[/b] or [b]##Vote Zona[/b]. Votes must be in bold, and votes not written in the correct fashion will not be counted. 
3. No conditional voting.
4. You may vote only for other living players in the thread.  You may not vote for yourself.
5. This game uses plurality voting, so whoever has the most votes at the end of the day is lynched. There is no minimum number of votes required to lynch someone. If there is a tie for most votes, whoever most recently had more votes than the other is the person who is up for the lynch.
6. The person who is up for the lynch is whoever has the most votes. Bringing another player up to that number of votes doesn't put him up for the lynch; he has to have the most votes. 
7. [b]Voting is mandatory. You may [u]NOT[/u] abstain.[/b]

[hr]
[green][center][b]Signups:[/b][/green][/center]
7 spots in this game are reserved for new players*.  The other 6 spots in this game are open to anyone, but new players still take priority and can possibly bump other players from these spots.

If you're a forum regular, please bear in mind there will be newbies in this game and act appropriately to introduce them to TL Mafia.

1.It's already in the rules, but remember, no editing. If you feel you must correct your post, please make a second post to clarify your statements. You may put EBWOP ("Edit by way of post," a handy acronym invented by semioldguy) at the beginning of your post to indicate that you are clearing up a point you made. If your EBWOP post is several posts after your original, please quote your original post in your EBWOP post for the sake of clarity.

2. Only sign up if you know you will have the time available to properly play the game. It is essential that players remain active in a newbie game, so only /in if you are able to play to your fullest.

3. If there is any sort of issue, you are unsure about some mechanic, or you are just wondering if your devilish scheme is even allowed, feel free to PM me, or ask in-thread with green text. Don't feel shy; these games are meant to be a place to learn and be open.

4. Behave as gentlemen (or ladies). Things get heated here, but personal attacks will not be acceptable, and will be dealt with accordingly. Remember, this is a game; have fun and happy scumhunting!

5. Please do not talk about any ongoing games either in-game or pre-game. This can affect other games and is unacceptable. Please do not refer to outside-of- thread activity of players in this thread.

6. If you receive coaching, don't tell town about it.

7. glhf!
